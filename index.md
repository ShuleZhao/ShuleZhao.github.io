## About Me

I am a Master student in school of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University(NPU), supervised by â€‹Prof. [Zhang Weiwei](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NEBn5mIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), with co-supervision from Prof. [Kou Jiaqing](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=sHFcEwMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on AI for aerodynamics and shape design. I earned my Bachelor of Engineering in Aircraft Design from NPU and continued my studies here as a graduate student under a guaranteed admission scheme.
## Research Interests

- **Fluid Mechanics:** Aerodynamic Modelling, Aerodynamic loads 
- **AI4S:** Physics embedded/guided machine learning, goal-oriented feature extractor
- **Aerodynamic design:** generative design, aerodynamic shape optimazition 

## News

- **[Aug. 2025]** Our paper on aerodynamic loads was accepted for publication in the Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics journal.
- **[Oct. 2024]** I was awarded the National Scholarship for Postgraduates!
- **[Sep. 2024]** I gave an oral presentation at the 34th Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS)!
- **[Sep. 2023]** I began my Master's degree in Mechanics at NWPU!
