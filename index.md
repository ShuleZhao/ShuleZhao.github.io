## About Me

I am a Master student in school of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by ​Prof. [Zhang Weiwei](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NEBn5mIAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao), with co-supervision from Prof. [Kou Jiaqing](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=sHFcEwMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on AI for aerodynamics and aircraft design. What's more, I completed my ​Bachelor of Engineering in Aircraft Design​ at Northwestern Polytechnical University and recommended for graduate admission without entrance examination.

## Research Interests

- **Fluid Mechanics:** Aerodynamic Modelling, Aerodynamic loads 
- **AI4S:** Physics embedded/guided machine learning, goal-oriented feature extractor
- **Aerodynamic design:** generative design, aerodynamic shape optimazition 

## News

- **[Aug. 2025]** Our paper on aerodynamic loads was accepted for publication in the Engineering Applications of Computational Fluid Mechanics journal.
- **[Oct. 2024]** I was awarded the National Scholarship for Postgraduates!
- **[Sep. 2024]** I gave an oral presentation at the 34th Congress of the International Council of the Aeronautical Sciences (ICAS)!
- **[Sep. 2023]** I began my Master's degree in Mechanics at NWPU!
