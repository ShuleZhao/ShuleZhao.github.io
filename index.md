## About Me

I am a Master student in school of Aeronautics, Northwestern Polytechnical University, supervised by ​Prof. [Zhang Weiwei](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NEBn5mIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao), with co-supervision from Prof. [Kou Jiaqing](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sWz5--8AAAAJ&hl=en). My research focuses on AI for aerodynamics and aircraft design.

Prior to this, I earned my ​Master of Engineering in Robotics​ from the National University of Singapore (NUS), where I conducted research under the guidance of ​Prof. [Chee Meng Chew](https://sites.google.com/site/cmchewhome/home)​ and ​Prof. [Hongliang Guo](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=vR9kUw8AAAAJ&hl=en), and completed my ​Bachelor of Engineering in Aircraft Design​ at Northwestern Polytechnical University (NWPU).
